# Akashi23

#### I'm a student at University :school: in last year :book: and I want to become TechLead Developer as soon as posible.
#### Why? I have several reasons :thought_balloon:

  - Because i want to know what is be Techlead  :muscle:
  - Of course because of Money :neutral_face:
  - And important reason is I want to know more than now and Techlead's level speaks for itself :sunglasses:

#### I use several programming language in my projects :pencil:

* Of course Python because I like Python :crown: and use for web and data analysis.<img src="https://github.com/Akashi23/Akashi23/blob/master/assets/python.png">
* JavaScripts for Web(Backend: NodeJS->Express, WebSocket.io, Frontend: VueJS)<img src="https://github.com/Akashi23/Akashi23/blob/master/assets/js.png">
* I studied C# for creating Windows application but now I focus on Python, JavaScript <img src="https://github.com/Akashi23/Akashi23/blob/master/assets/file-and-folder.png">
* I studied Java because of comparing with each other language just Syntax and no more<img src="https://github.com/Akashi23/Akashi23/blob/master/assets/java.png">
* I learnt C++ in my University program but same situation with C# and Java <img src="https://github.com/Akashi23/Akashi23/blob/master/assets/software-development.png">

 I studied difference language and reason is very simple. I wanted to know :book: a lot. How works program in different language :pencil2:, how to develop something new in several language and just I was interesting :open_mouth:. However, the more i was knowing the merrier i realized situation around concepts :neutral_face: . OOP, REST API, API and another concepts are very important for programming. And now I'm studying several concepts(SOLID, KIS, Clean code, etc) :bookmark_tabs: .

 
 #### I use several technology such as databases, containerazation, test_tools, OS :pencil:
 * NoSQL database MongoDB, Redis <img src="https://github.com/Akashi23/Akashi23/blob/master/assets/database.png">
 * I worked with MySQL database <img src="https://github.com/Akashi23/Akashi23/blob/master/assets/mysql.png">
 * For containerazation I use Docker <img src="https://github.com/Akashi23/Akashi23/blob/master/assets/docker.png">
 * I worked with Linux but now I use GitBash instead OS Linux and his terminal <img src="https://github.com/Akashi23/Akashi23/blob/master/assets/linux.png">
 * Postman for testing Rest API
